# Movie-Script

Movies come with subtitles. `srt` is one of the famous subtitle formats. They have a time stamp and the phrase for each dialog in the movie.

## Task

Choose any movie you like and find the subtitle file. Write a script using any language of your preference to extract the wording and generate a file containing the dialogs in human readable format without timestamps and encodings that are not words.

Open a new issue for every movie script entry you make and send a PR fixing that issue.

### Example

`Input`
> 01:12:15:120 Hello, this is one line in dialog

> 01:12:15:950 This is the second line in dialog

`Output`
> Hello, this is one line in dialog. This is the second line in dialog.

### Deliverables

We require the following deliverables in a folder named after the movie you chose.

1. Subtitle file
2. Script in any language of your preference generating the output
3. Output text file
